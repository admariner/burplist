## Introduction

This is the web crawlers repository of https://burplist.me built using Scrapy.

The site serves as a search engine for craft beers in Singapore, providing craft beer lovers pricing information for their favorite beer.

I have also documented some of my thought process while creating Burplist [here](https://jerrynsh.com/how-i-built-burplist-for-free/). Enjoy!

## Development

Make sure you have [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) and [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

```sh
poetry install

# Optional: Installing dependencies only
poetry install --no-root

# Optional: Updating dependencies to their latest versions
poetry update
```

### Setup pre-commit Hooks

Before you begin your development work, make sure you have installed [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/index.html#installation).

Some example useful invocations:

-   `pre-commit install`: Default invocation. Installs the pre-commit script alongside any existing git hooks.
-   `pre-commit install --install-hooks --overwrite`: Idempotently replaces existing git hook scripts with pre-commit, and also installs hook environments.

### Database

**Optional: DB Migration**

For database migration steps, please read [this](alembic/README.md). You would only need this if you update any database models. Not needed for fresh installation.

**With `docker-compose`**

```sh
docker-compose up
```

**OR Without `docker-compose`**

-   To spin up a PostgreSQL Docker instance locally

    ```sh
    docker run -d --name dpostgres -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust postgres:latest
    ```

-   To start the PostgreSQL Docker container, simply use `docker start dpostgres`.
-   To run `psql`, do `docker exec -it dpostgres psql -U postgres`
-   Create a database name as `burplist` using `CREATE DATABASE burplist;`
-   To build a `burplist` Docker image:
    ```sh
    # NOTE: Dockerfile `PG_HOST=172.17.0.1` because that is the IP address gateway of container_
    docker build -t burplist .
    ```
-   To run from the newly built image, do `docker run --name burplist burplist`

```sh
# To list all spiders
poetry run scrapy crawl list

# To run a single spider
poetry run scrapy crawl fairprice

```

### Run all spiders

```sh
poetry run scrapy list | xargs -n 1 poetry run scrapy crawl

# Optional: Run on Heroku
heroku run scrapy list | xargs -n 1 heroku run scrapy crawl
```

### Run all spiders, in parallel

```sh
poetry shell
scrapy list | xargs -n 1 -P 0 scrapy crawl

We use [ScraperAPI](https://www.scraperapi.com/) as our proxy server provider.

```sh
# Optional:
export SCRAPER_API_KEY="YOUR_SCRAPER_API_KEY"
export SENTRY_DSN="YOUR_SENTRY_DSN"
```
