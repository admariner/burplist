## Installation

Make sure you have [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) installed on your machine.

```sh
poetry install
```

## Setup Pre-commit Hooks

Before you begin your development work, make sure you have installed [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/index.html#installation).

Some example useful invocations:

-   `pre-commit install`: Default invocation. Installs the pre-commit script alongside any existing git hooks.
-   `pre-commit install --install-hooks --overwrite`: Idempotently replaces existing git hook scripts with pre-commit, and also installs hook environments

## Start Crawling

### Run single spider

```sh
# To list all spiders
poetry run scrapy crawl list

# To run a single spider
poetry run scrapy crawl fairprice

# To run single spider with json output
poetry run scrapy crawl coldstorage -o coldstorage.json
```

### Run all spiders

```sh
poetry run scrapy list | xargs -n 1 poetry run scrapy crawl

# Run on Heroku
heroku run scrapy list | xargs -n 1 heroku run scrapy crawl
```

### Run all spiders, in parallel

```sh
scrapy list | xargs -n 1 -P 0 scrapy crawl
```

## Using Proxy (For Production)

```sh
export SCRAPER_API_KEY="YOUR_SCRAPER_API_KEY"
```

## Useful SQL Queries

To get the price list of all available products

```sql
SELECT
	product_id,
	platform AS "Platform",
	name AS "Product Name",
	brand AS "Brand",
	style AS "Style",
	abv AS "ABV",
	volume AS "Volume (mL)",
	round(price::numeric, 2) AS "Price ($SGD)",
	quantity AS "Quantity (Unit)",
	round((price / quantity)::numeric, 2) AS "Price/Quantity ($SGD)",
	url AS "Product Link",
	TO_CHAR(price.updated_on::TIMESTAMP AT TIME ZONE 'SGT', 'dd/mm/yyyy') AS "Updated On (SGT)"
FROM
	product
	INNER JOIN price ON price.product_id = product.id
ORDER BY
	price / quantity ASC
```

To get the number of prices of all available products

```sql
SELECT
	product.id,
	platform AS "Platform",
	brand AS "Brand",
	name AS "Product Name",
	quantity AS "Quantity (Unit)",
	url AS "Product Link",
	count(price.product_id) AS "Number of Prices"
FROM
	product
	LEFT JOIN price ON (product.id = price.product_id)
GROUP BY
	product.id
```
