## Useful SQL Queries

To get the price list of all available products

```sql
SELECT
	product_id,
	vendor AS "Vendor",
	name AS "Product Name",
	round(price::numeric, 2) AS "Price ($SGD)",
	quantity AS "Quantity (Unit)",
	round((price / quantity)::numeric, 2) AS "Price/Quantity ($SGD)",
	url AS "Product Link",
	TO_CHAR(price.updated_on::TIMESTAMP AT TIME ZONE 'SGT', 'dd/mm/yyyy') AS "Updated On (SGT)"
FROM
	product
	INNER JOIN price ON price.product_id = product.id
ORDER BY
	price / quantity ASC
```

## Querying Item With Scrapy Shell

```python
from sqlalchemy import and_
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from burplist.models import Price, Product, create_table, db_connect


engine = db_connect()
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

url = 'https://coldstorage.com.sg/green-label-24s-5022003'
quantity = 24

try:
    existing_product = session.query(Product).filter_by(url=url, quantity=quantity).one_or_none()
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
finally:
    session.close()
```
